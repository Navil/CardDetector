% Otsu's method is used to seperate backgound and foreground.
% We want to find a threshold, where the means of the foreground and
% background differ the most. Thus we want to maximize the variance between
% the classes and minimize the variance within the classes.

% Parameter: a grayscale image
% Returnvalue: a binary image, where the threshold is applied
