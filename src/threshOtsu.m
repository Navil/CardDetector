% DETECTCARD Detects playing cards in an image and prints their values.
%   DETECTCARD(FILENAME)    reads the image specified by FILENAME
%                           in either .png, .tiff or .jpeg format

%                           textual output to the console.

% Otsu's method is used to seperate backgound and foreground.
% We want to find a threshold, where the means of the foreground and
% background differ the most. Thus we want to maximize the variance between
% the classes and minimize the variance within the classes.
